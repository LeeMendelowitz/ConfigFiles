This is a place where I keep my config files for git, vim, etc.
The `env.sh` file defines aliases and bash functions that I use a lot.

If you would like to use a configuration similar to mine,
here are the installation instructions:


```bash


# Clone into ~/config:
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/LeeMendelowitz/ConfigFiles.git ~/config

# Add the config/bin path to your .bashrc.
# Edit your .bashrc manually or use this:
cat >>~/.bashrc <<'EOF'
export PATH=~/config/bin:$PATH
source ~/config/env.sh
EOF

```

The last step is to copy any dot-files (`.*`) from config to your home directory.
I leave this to you, depending on what you would like to use.

For example, to use the `.vimrc`:

```bash
cp ~/config/.vimrc ~
```
